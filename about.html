      <p>Wakai is no stranger to the power of music. Growing up in Baton Rougue, Louisiana, the 18-year-old rapper found early inspiration from his father's personal collection of music, which included artists like OutKast, Erykah Badu, Earth, Wind + Fire, and many more. Currently drawing inspiration from artists like Isaiah Rashad, Knxwledge, and J.I.D just to name a few, he is continually crafting his sound with inspiration from artists both old and new. Wakai has a unique ability to grasp the listener's ear with distinctive cadences and meaningful lyrics that detail the untold stories of what it's like to grow up in Baton Rouge today. As one of six members of the artist collective Col-Der-Sac and the co-founder of clothing brand Upperkut, he is constantly searching for new ways to express creativity. Wakai has recently been working closely with producer attaboijim and is not looking to slow his roll any time soon. Don't sleep on Wakai as he continues to expand his unique sound and reach new heights as an artist and creative.</p>
